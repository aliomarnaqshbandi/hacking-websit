            <h3>Nikto</h3>
            <p>Nikto is an Open Source software written in Perl language that is used to scan a web-server for the vulnerability that can be exploited and can compromise the server. It can also check for outdated version details of 1200 server and can detect problems with specific version details of over 200 servers. It can also fingerprint server using favicon.ico files present in the server. It is not designed to be a particularly a stealth tool rather than it is designed to be fast and time-efficient to achieve the task in very little time. Because of this, a web admin can easily detect that its server is being scanned by looking into the log files. 
                It can also show some items that do not have security problem but are info only which shows how to take full use of it to secure the web-server more properly. </p>

    <li>Knockpy</li>
    <p>Knockpy is a portable and modular Python 3 tool designed for quickly enumerating subdomains on a target domain through passive reconnaissance and dictionary scans. Here are some key features of Knockpy:</p>
    <li>Fast and Easy: Knockpy provides a straightforward way to discover subdomains without complex setup or configuration.</li>
    <li>Multiple Techniques: It leverages various sources, including Google, Bing, DNS, and Whois, to find subdomains.</li>
    <li>Wordlist-Based Bruteforce: You can use a wordlist (either the built-in one or your own) to bruteforce subdomains.</li>
    <li>Customization Options: Customize DNS servers, user agents, timeouts, and threads for scanning</li>

       <h3>Virtual-host-discovery<h3> 
        <p>During the testing reconnaissance phase, testers spend time on virtual host enumeration, which is the process of discovering all the virtual hosts associated with a particular IP address or domain. This helps them find hidden or undocumented assets that might be vulnerable or misconfigured.<p>

            <h3>Nmap<h3>
                <p>Nmap, short for Network Mapper, is a free and open-source tool used for vulnerability checking, port scanning, and, of course, network mapping1. It runs from a host system and conducts controlled scans of target hosts, subnets, and networks, gathering information such as IP addresses, port status, and operating systems2. Security professionals and administrators use Nmap for various tasks, including inventorying networks, vulnerability scanning, identifying network services, and validating router configurations2. If youâ€™re interested in exploring your network or assessing its security, Nmap is a valuable utility to have in your toolkit! ðŸ˜Š<p>
